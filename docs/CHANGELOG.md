# UiSymbolPicker Changelog

## 0.3.8 - Responsive section header sizing

- Added width-aware SymbolPicker section-header sizing so wrapped Library/Collections action rows reserve their measured Flow height instead of being clipped by a one-line outer header.
- Kept the title cards and action clusters on the same outer header row; only the inner action clusters wrap.
- Restored the compact Library Categories heading height and reduced the heading-to-category-flow gap so category buttons sit directly under the title/subtitle again.
- Kept the responsive sizing local to SymbolPicker rather than changing shared `UiBoxLayout` behavior.

## 0.3.7 - Theme, header flow, help, and export feedback polish

- Restored the intended same-row Library and Collections header composition with the original expanding spacer and natural-width filters while retaining Flow wrapping inside the action clusters.
- Synchronized the SymbolPicker dark toggle with `UiThemeMode` as well as the U++ skin so explicitly resolved `Ui` control styles now switch to their real dark equivalents.
- Added medium-dark section/scroll surfaces in dark mode and white Library/Collection icon previews without changing stored/export tint values.
- Re-resolve custom header, collection, dropdown, tool-button, and empty-state styles when switching appearance; key tool icons also use high-contrast dark-mode tinting.
- Improved successful export feedback so the exported filename/result is prominent above a smaller path line, with optional warning/detail text below.
- Expanded Help into a structured workflow guide covering categories, selection, collections, project save/load, export formats, and the paired U++ IML + header library workflow.

## 0.3.6 - Selection, layout, and U++ library export refinements

- Added Library Shift range selection and Ctrl+Shift additive visible-range selection to match Collections.
- Canonicalized project Save As suffixes so `.uppicons`, `.json`, repeated `.uppicons`, and case variants resolve to exactly one `.uppicons.json` suffix.
- Preselect save/export dialogs with a complete valid path instead of a filename at a virtual disk-selection location.
- Made Library and Collections header/action layouts wrap with auto-resize so filter fields remain visible at narrower window widths.
- Standardized successful export feedback around `Export complete`, with filename and path shown separately.
- Added `U++ IML + Header Library`, producing a sibling `.iml` + `.h` pair from one deterministic emission pass.
- Generated IML library headers expose icon wrappers, category/catalog metadata, and an opt-in one-translation-unit `iml_source.h` implementation switch.
- Extended IML startup smoke coverage over paired IML/header generation and its U++ integration contract.

## 0.3.5 - Collection and export acceptance repairs

- Reject Library-to-Collection duplicate drops while allowing partial grouped drops and reporting skipped duplicates.
- Keep logical collection selection synchronized after Delete so repeated deletion chains correctly.
- Added Shift range selection, active-collection removal, blank-and-active collection creation, and a one-command Clear collection action.
- Hardened `.uppicons.json` Save As handling and added explicit default extensions/file filters for U++ header and IML exports.
- Clarified that U++ IML export is a single `.iml` payload; warning sidecars remain conditional on actual export warnings.
- Wired the light/dark toggle through U++ runtime skin switching and made custom tile/drop colors theme-responsive.
- Replaced the inert Help action with concise in-app workflow guidance.

## 0.3.4 - Captured gesture stability

- Added one explicit captured gesture tracker shared by library and collection tiles.
- Intentional capture release no longer reports cancellation before completion.
- Terminal results carry stable source identity and release screen position.
- Added deterministic lifecycle smoke coverage, including 1,000 mixed cycles.
- Added a mouse-transparent drag preview and multi-selection count.
- Collection selection now updates tiles in place instead of destroying the active tile.
- Filtered collection reorder now uses underlying collection item indexes.
- Removed per-gesture tooltip registration churn; tile tooltips remain disabled.
- Separated normal result/selection status from Debug-only timing and gesture evidence.
- Suppressed broad model refresh for Bin-only additions.

## 0.4.6

- replaced the collection-only JSON stub with project-level `.uppicons.json` I/O
- added `SymbolPickerProject` metadata and model snapshot import/export
- wired Save / Save As / Load to real file dialogs in the runtime shell
- added project JSON roundtrip smoke coverage at startup
- kept export/header generation out of scope for this pass

## 0.3.3

- rebuilt `SymbolPickerView` around the Designer hierarchy
- removed the old splitter/table/Bin-pane shell
- moved runtime content into the three scroll-panel hosts
- preserved model/catalog/command behavior
- kept generated catalog loading paused

## 0.3.2

- strengthened command smoke tests for `catalog_id` / `source_id` preservation
